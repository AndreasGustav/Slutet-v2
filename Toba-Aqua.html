        <p>
          <strong> Toba Aquarium </strong> (鳥羽水族館, Toba-suizokukan) is a
          public aquarium, which is located in Toba, Mie, Japan. The aquarium
          houses 12 zones which reproduce natural environments, housing some
          25,000 individuals representing 1,200 species. The guests are free to
          tour the aquarium's grounds in any manner they please, as there is no
          fixed route. The total length of the aisle is about 1.5 kilometers.<br />

          History Toba Aquarium opened May 1955. It was founded by Haruaki
          Nakamura(中村幸昭), now the honorary president. It has received more
          than 50 million visitors, making it one of the most visited locations
          in Japan. The aquarium hosts scholarly investigations as an adult
          education institution in conjunction with the Ministry of Education,
          Culture, Sports, Science and Technology officially specifying the Toba
          Aquarium as a museum. Toba Aquarium also emphasizes protection and
